# Cold Email Outreach

End-to-end cold outreach: research, draft, send, follow up, route replies. Strategy is grounded in proven hook frameworks (number-led / question / pain-point / benefit-first); the execution runs on Apollo, Firecrawl, the LinkedIn scraper, and Gmail through the Hyper MCP.

## Out of scope — defer to other skills

| Request | Send them to |
| --- | --- |
| Lifecycle / nurture sequences for *warm* leads (welcome, onboarding, re-engagement, win-back) | `email-lifecycle` (planned) |
| LinkedIn DMs, connection requests, or Sales Navigator workflows | (planned) |
| Lead scoring, routing, deal-stage updates after a reply | `crm-revops` (planned) |
| Scraping competitor *ads* | `meta-ads-library` |

## Requirements

- **Hyper MCP installed and connected.** [https://app.hyperfx.ai/mcp](https://app.hyperfx.ai/mcp)
- **Gmail integration** connected at [https://app.hyperfx.ai/integrations](https://app.hyperfx.ai/integrations) — supplies the sending account.
- **Apollo integration** connected — supplies prospect search and email enrichment.
- **Firecrawl** (bundled) — for company-page signals.
- **Optional: LinkedIn scraper** (bundled, runs through Apify) — for richer per-prospect personalization.

If `gmail_send_message` and `apollo_mixed_people_search` are not in the agent's tool list, stop and tell the user to enable the Hyper MCP and connect Gmail + Apollo.

## Tool surface

| Phase | Tools |
| --- | --- |
| Prospect research | `apollo_mixed_people_search`, `apollo_mixed_companies_search`, `apollo_people_bulk_match` (preferred for 2+ enrich), `apollo_people_match` (single only) |
| Per-prospect signals | `firecrawl_scrape_url`, `firecrawl_batch_scrape`, `firecrawl_extract_branding`, `firecrawl_screenshot`, `scrape_linkedin_profiles` *(conditional — requires LinkedIn Apify integration)* |
| Drafting | `gmail_create_draft`, `gmail_update_draft`, `gmail_get_draft`, `gmail_list_drafts` |
| Sending | `gmail_send_message`, `gmail_send_draft`, `gmail_reply_to_message` |
| Reply routing | `gmail_list_messages`, `gmail_get_message`, `gmail_create_label`, `gmail_add_labels`, `gmail_remove_labels`, `gmail_move_email_to_label` *(takes `label_id` string, not `label_ids` array)* |

## Critical rules

1. **Never loop `apollo_people_match` for multiple prospects.** For 2+ records always batch into `apollo_people_bulk_match`. Apollo's tool description warns about this explicitly — looping single-match calls burns credits and is much slower.
2. **Default send mode = drafts-first for review.** For any campaign with 4+ prospects, draft the first 1–3 with `gmail_create_draft`, show them to the user, get explicit approval, then batch-send the rest with `gmail_send_message`. Never send a full campaign without showing samples first.
3. **One label per campaign.** Create a `cold/<campaign-name>` label with `gmail_create_label` at the start, apply it to every send, then track replies by searching that label. This is what makes Phase 6 reply routing actually work.
4. **Stay under Gmail's send limits.** ~500 messages/day per consumer Gmail account, ~2,000/day per Workspace user. Space sends out — see [`references/deliverability.md`](./references/deliverability.md) for warming and per-day pacing.
5. **Personalization must connect to the problem.** If the personalized opener could be deleted and the email still makes sense, it isn't doing any work. The opener should naturally bridge into *why you're emailing*.
6. **One ask per email, one CTA.** Interest-based (`Worth exploring?`) beats meeting requests on cold touch 1.
7. **Honor unsubscribes immediately.** Apply an `unsubscribed` label on any "remove me / not interested" reply and never re-target that address from the same Hyper workspace.

## Workflow

### Phase 1 — Define the campaign (always do this first)

Get the user to commit to:

1. **ICP** — Role(s), industry, company size, tech stack, geography. Concrete: "Heads of Growth at US-based pre-seed-to-Series-A B2B SaaS, 10–50 employees, using HubSpot."
2. **The ask** — What does a "yes" look like? (15-min call, async reply, demo, intro to someone else.)
3. **Value prop in one sentence** — "We help X do Y so they can Z."
4. **Proof point** — One specific result: "We helped Notion cut their CAC by 31% in 90 days." (Made up examples are worse than no example — get a real one.)
5. **Trigger / signal (optional but powerful)** — Funding round, hiring, pricing-page change, recent blog post, product launch, leadership change.
6. **Sender + reply-to** — Which Gmail account is sending. (Confirm with `gmail_list_labels` to verify the integration is live.)
7. **Volume + cadence** — Total prospects, max sends/day, follow-up gap pattern.

If they're stuck on any of these, push back. A campaign without proof or a clear ask will not perform regardless of how clever the writing is.

### Phase 2 — Build & enrich the prospect list

```
# Search by ICP
apollo_mixed_people_search(
  person_titles=["Head of Growth", "VP Growth", "Director of Growth"],
  organization_num_employees_ranges=["11,50"],
  person_locations=["United States"],
  per_page=50,
)
```

Then for the prospects you actually want to contact, batch-enrich for emails:

```
# CORRECT — one bulk call for many prospects
apollo_people_bulk_match(
  details=[
    {"first_name": "...", "last_name": "...", "domain": "..."},
    ...up to 10 per call...
  ],
  reveal_personal_emails=True,
)
```

Only fall back to `apollo_people_match` for single-prospect lookups (e.g., the user pastes one LinkedIn URL).

For deeper company-level context (industry, revenue range, tech stack), call `apollo_mixed_companies_search` by organization name on the companies you want to enrich. Note that person search results already include core company fields (headcount, industry, location) — only reach for `apollo_mixed_companies_search` when you need data beyond what the person search returns.

### Phase 3 — Per-prospect signals (the personalization layer)

For each prospect, gather one *specific* observation that connects to the problem you solve. Use the cheapest signal that works:

| Cost | Tool | Use it for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Free (already have it) | Apollo response fields | Title change, recent role start, company headcount jump, funding |
| Cheap | `firecrawl_scrape_url` of the careers / pricing / blog page | "You're hiring 4 SDRs", "Pricing pages says enterprise plan launching", "Latest blog post is about X" |
| Cheap (multi-page) | `firecrawl_batch_scrape` | Same observation across many sites in one call |
| Medium | `firecrawl_extract_branding` | Brand voice for the email tone, brand colors if you'll send a follow-up image |
| Higher *(conditional)* | `scrape_linkedin_profiles(profile_urls=[...])` *(requires LinkedIn Apify integration — skip if not connected)* | Recent post, mutual connection, recent job change, school/employer overlap |

Personalization tiers (use the highest tier you can afford for *this* campaign):

- **Tier 1 (mass / low-effort)** — first name + role + company + industry. Acceptable only when the *value prop* is sharp enough to carry the email on its own. Reply rates: low.
- **Tier 2 (signal-based)** — the prospect is in a role/stage where the problem you solve is acute (e.g., a new Head of Growth in their first 60 days). Reply rates: meaningfully better.
- **Tier 3 (observation-based)** — references something from the company site, pricing page, careers page, or a recent product launch. This is the sweet spot.
- **Tier 4 (deep)** — references a recent LinkedIn post, blog post they wrote, or talk they gave. Reserve for high-value targets.

Anything below Tier 2 should be treated with suspicion — `{{FirstName}}` swaps don't count as personalization.

### Phase 4 — Draft emails (drafts-first by default)

Pick a framework that matches the situation. The four shapes that consistently work:

- **Observation → Problem → Proof → Ask** — "You're hiring SDRs. That usually means meetings/SDR ratio is the bottleneck. We helped [company] hit X. Worth exploring?"
- **Question → Value → Ask** — "Struggling with [problem]? We do [Y]. [Company Z] saw [result]. Worth a look?"
- **Trigger → Insight → Ask** — "Congrats on [funding/launch]. That usually creates [Y challenge]. We've helped similar teams with that. Curious?"
- **Story → Bridge → Ask** — "[Similar company] had [problem]. They [solved it this way with us]. Relevant to you?"

See [`references/frameworks.md`](./references/frameworks.md) for full examples and when each shape works best.

**Subject lines.** Short, lowercase, internal-looking. 2–4 words. No emojis, no first names, no urgency tricks. Targets: looks-like-a-colleague-sent-it. Examples: `quick question`, `reply rates`, `hiring ops`, `q3 forecast`, `for {{company}}`. Avoid: `Increase your revenue 10x!`, `John, are you free Thursday?`, `[URGENT] follow-up`.

**Voice rules.**

- Write like a peer, not a vendor. Use contractions. Read it aloud — if it sounds like marketing copy, rewrite it.
- "You/your" should outnumber "I/we" by ≥2:1.
- Every sentence must move the reader toward replying. The best cold emails feel like they could have been *shorter*, not longer.
- Calibrate to seniority: C-suite → ultra-brief and peer-level. Mid-level → more specific value. Technical → precise, no fluff, respect their intelligence.

**What to avoid (these are the AI-tells reviewers immediately spot):**

- "I hope this email finds you well." / "I came across your profile."
- "leverage", "synergy", "best-in-class", "leading provider", "circle back"
- Feature dumps. One proof point beats ten features.
- HTML, images, multiple links.
- Fake `Re:` / `Fwd:` subject lines.
- Identical templates with only `{{FirstName}}` swapped.
- Asking for a 30-minute call on touch 1.

**Drafts-first send pattern (default for any 4+ prospect campaign):**

```
# 1. Create label for the campaign once — capture the returned id
label = gmail_create_label(name="cold/q3-growth-leads")
campaign_label_id = label["id"]

# 2. Draft the first 1-3 prospects for user review
for p in prospects[:3]:
    gmail_create_draft(
      to=p["email"],
      subject="quick question",
      body=render_email(framework="observation", prospect=p),
    )

# 3. Show drafts to user, await explicit approval

# 4. After approval, send and label each message
for p in prospects[3:]:
    result = gmail_send_message(
      to=p["email"],
      subject="quick question",
      body=render_email(framework="observation", prospect=p),
    )
    gmail_add_labels(message_id=result["id"], label_ids=[campaign_label_id])
```

If the user wants every email reviewed, use `gmail_create_draft` for all of them and send via `gmail_send_draft` after approval. If the user is confident and the templates are pre-approved (e.g., they've run this campaign shape before), you can skip directly to `gmail_send_message` from prospect 1. Default behavior is drafts-first.

### Phase 5 — Run the follow-up cadence

3–5 total touches with widening gaps. Each follow-up adds something new — a different angle, fresh proof, a useful resource. "Just checking in" gives the reader no reason to respond.

Default cadence (adjust to the user's situation):

| Touch | Day | Angle | Tool |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0 | Initial framework (observation/question/trigger/story) | `gmail_send_message` |
| 2 | +3 | Reply in the same thread, add a one-line specific proof | `gmail_reply_to_message` |
| 3 | +7 | Different angle (if 1 was observation, try question or value-first) | `gmail_reply_to_message` |
| 4 | +14 | Useful free resource — case study, calculator, teardown | `gmail_reply_to_message` |
| 5 | +21 | Breakup email. "Closing your file unless I hear back. Worth keeping the door open?" | `gmail_reply_to_message` |

Always reply in the original thread (`gmail_reply_to_message` with the `message_id` returned from the touch-1 send) — preserves context and improves deliverability. See [`references/follow-up-sequences.md`](./references/follow-up-sequences.md) for angle rotation, breakup-email templates, and how to prune prospects mid-sequence.

### Phase 6 — Track replies and route them

```
# Pull all replies on the campaign label from the last 7 days
gmail_list_messages(query="label:cold/q3-growth-leads is:unread newer_than:7d")
```

For each reply, read the body with `gmail_get_message(message_id=...)`, classify it, and label:

| Classification | Label | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Interested ("yes / tell me more / send a calendar") | `cold/q3-growth-leads/interested` | Stop the sequence. Hand off (eventually `crm-revops` once shipped). |
| Objection ("we use X / no budget / try us in Q4") | `cold/q3-growth-leads/objection` | Reply with one specific response, then stop sequence. |
| Not now ("circle back later") | `cold/q3-growth-leads/not-now` | Stop sequence. Re-tag for re-engagement in 90 days. |
| Unsubscribe ("remove me / not interested") | `cold/q3-growth-leads/unsubscribed` | Stop sequence. Add `unsubscribed` global label. Never re-contact. |
| Out-of-office | `cold/q3-growth-leads/ooo` | Pause sequence, resume after the OOO end date in the message. |

Apply classification and clear unread with two separate calls:

```
gmail_add_labels(message_id=..., label_ids=[classification_label_id])
gmail_remove_labels(message_id=..., label_ids=["UNREAD"])
```

Create the sub-labels once with `gmail_create_label` and capture their IDs before the routing loop.

## Quality check (before any send)

Read each draft against this gut-check. Reject any that fail more than one:

- Does it sound like a human wrote it? (Read it aloud.)
- Would *you* reply if you got this?
- Does every sentence serve the reader, not the sender?
- Is the personalization connected to *the problem you solve* — not just a generic compliment?
- Is there one clear, low-friction ask?
- Does the subject line look like it came from a colleague?
- Is the email under ~120 words on touch 1?
