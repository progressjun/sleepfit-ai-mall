# Google Ads

Strategic guide for building new Google Ads campaigns. Research first, consult intelligently, validate everything, and use the blueprint flow for controlled creation.

## Requirements

- **Hyper MCP installed and connected.** [https://app.hyperfx.ai/mcp](https://app.hyperfx.ai/mcp)
- **Google Ads integration connected** at [https://app.hyperfx.ai/integrations](https://app.hyperfx.ai/integrations).

If `google_ads_list_accounts` is not in the tool list, stop and tell the user to enable Hyper MCP and connect Google Ads.

## Out of scope

- **Ongoing optimization** (search-term cleanup, bid adjustments, ad testing, restructuring existing campaigns) → defer to a future `google-ads-operator` skill.
- **Creative generation** (headlines, descriptions, images) → [`ad-creative-generation`](../ad-creative-generation).
- **Cross-platform campaign launches** → use this skill for Google, then invoke `meta-ads` / `tiktok-ads` separately.

## Tool surface

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `google_ads_list_accounts` | Discover accessible accounts (and MCC sub-accounts). |
| `google_ads_execute_gaql` | Run a GAQL query (conversion actions, search term reports, etc.). |
| `google_ads_search_locations` | Resolve human-readable location names to IDs. |
| `google_ads_list_assets`, `google_ads_upload_image_asset` | Manage image assets for Display / PMax. |
| `google_ads_preview_blueprint`, `google_ads_create_from_blueprint` | Validate + create Search/Display campaigns. |
| `google_ads_preview_pmax_blueprint`, `google_ads_create_from_pmax_blueprint` | Validate + create Performance Max campaigns. |

## Phase 1: Initial Setup

Call `google_ads_list_accounts()` to list accessible accounts.

- If multiple: ask the user to select one.
- If single: inform the user and proceed.

**CRITICAL**: Verify account access before any operations.

## Phase 2: Discovery & Research (MANDATORY)

### Research Steps
1. Get the real domain (ask; don't infer).
2. Scan the site end-to-end: home, product/service, pricing, about, FAQs, locations, contact, landing pages.
3. Understand funnel & goals: primary conversions, CTAs, forms/checkout, thank-you pages.
4. Extract messaging: value props, differentiators, proof, offers.

### Conversion Tracking Check
Before asking questions, run the purpose-built diagnostic (simpler than a hand-rolled GAQL query):
```
google_ads_diagnose_conversion_tracking(customer_id="<from list_accounts>")
```

This returns all conversion actions, their status, and any tracking signal issues in one call. If the user's MCP doesn't expose `google_ads_diagnose_conversion_tracking`, fall back to GAQL:
```
google_ads_execute_gaql(
  customer_id="<from list_accounts>",
  query="""
    SELECT conversion_action.id, conversion_action.name,
           conversion_action.status, conversion_action.type
    FROM conversion_action
    WHERE conversion_action.status = 'ENABLED'
  """
)
```

> **`google_ads_execute_gaql` vs `google_ads_run_gaql`:** `execute_gaql` works on manager accounts (MCC) and sub-accounts. `run_gaql` is only available on non-manager accounts. Use `execute_gaql` consistently — it works everywhere.

### Market & Keyword Research
- Inspect SERPs, competitors, and themes.
- Propose keyword candidates (intent-aligned).
- Identify initial negatives.

### Confirm Criticals
- Daily budget (+currency).
- Served geos.
- Constraints.
- Tracking status.

## Phase 3: Consultation

Act as a partner, not order-taker:
- Present findings (site + GAQL + market).
- Recommend bidding (default Smart Bidding when tracking exists) with trade-offs.
- Propose structure (campaign → themed ad groups → keywords + match types).
- Suggest locations via `google_ads_search_locations(customer_id="...", location_names="New York")`. Note: `location_names` is a single string, not an array — pass a city, state, country, or postal code and the tool returns matching geo target IDs.
- Set budget expectations via benchmark ranges.
- Show reasoning for each choice.

## Phase 4: Pre-Creation Summary (Must Be Approved)

```
Campaign Strategy for [Business Name]

Sources: [URL], GAQL
Conversion Setup: [GAQL findings]
Primary Goal: [objective + why]
Bidding: [strategy + why]
Budget: $[X]/day (expectations)
Locations: [targets + rationale]
Keyword Themes: [themes + match types + 2-3 examples]
Messaging: [angles pulled from site]
Trade-offs/Risks: [bullets]

Approve to proceed?
```

Wait for explicit approval. No emojis. No assumptions.

## Phase 5: Campaign Creation (Blueprint System)

> **CRITICAL**: Always use the blueprint system for campaign creation. It validates locally, fills smart defaults, resolves locations, and rolls back on failure.

### Workflow: Preview → Confirm → Create

1. Build the blueprint JSON from research.
2. Call the **preview** tool to validate and show the user what will be created.
3. Get explicit user approval.
4. Call the **create** tool.

### Search & Display Campaigns

**Preview**: `google_ads_preview_blueprint(blueprint={...})`
**Create**: `google_ads_create_from_blueprint(blueprint={...})`

```json
{
  "customer_id": "1234567890",
  "name": "Campaign Name",
  "budget_amount_micros": 50000000,
  "advertising_channel_type": "SEARCH",
  "bidding_strategy": "MAXIMIZE_CLICKS",
  "status": "PAUSED",
  "location_names": ["New York", "Los Angeles"],  // array in blueprints; note: google_ads_search_locations takes a single string for manual lookup
  "conversion_action_ids": ["1234567890"],
  "ad_schedules": [
    {"day_of_week": "MONDAY", "start_hour": 9, "end_hour": 17}
  ],
  "sitelinks": [
    {"link_text": "Free Trial", "final_urls": ["https://example.com/trial"]}
  ],
  "callouts": [{"callout_text": "Free Shipping"}],
  "ad_groups": [
    {
      "name": "Ad Group 1",
      "keywords": [
        {"text": "marketing software", "match_type": "PHRASE"},
        {"text": "competitor brand", "match_type": "EXACT", "negative": true}
      ],
      "ads": [
        {
          "headlines": ["Headline 1", "Headline 2", "Headline 3"],
          "descriptions": ["Description 1", "Description 2"],
          "final_urls": ["https://example.com"]
        }
      ],
      "audiences": [{"audience_id": "1234567890"}]
    }
  ]
}
```

For **Display** campaigns, set `"advertising_channel_type": "DISPLAY"` and use `display_ads` instead of `ads`:
```json
"display_ads": [{
  "headlines": ["Headline 1", "Headline 2", "Headline 3"],
  "long_headline": "Longer headline up to 90 characters",
  "descriptions": ["Description 1", "Description 2"],
  "business_name": "Business Name",
  "final_urls": ["https://example.com"],
  "marketing_image_asset_ids": ["1234567890"],
  "square_marketing_image_asset_ids": ["1234567891"],
  "logo_asset_ids": ["1234567892"]
}]
```

> **CRITICAL (Display)**: All three image asset types are REQUIRED:
> - `marketing_image_asset_ids` — landscape 1.91:1 (e.g. 1200×628).
> - `square_marketing_image_asset_ids` — square 1:1 (e.g. 1200×1200).
> - `logo_asset_ids` — square 1:1 or landscape 4:1.

### Performance Max Campaigns

**Preview**: `google_ads_preview_pmax_blueprint(blueprint={...})`
**Create**: `google_ads_create_from_pmax_blueprint(blueprint={...})`

```json
{
  "customer_id": "1234567890",
  "name": "PMax Campaign",
  "budget_amount_micros": 50000000,
  "bidding_strategy": "MAXIMIZE_CONVERSIONS",
  "status": "PAUSED",
  "location_names": ["United States"],
  "conversion_action_ids": ["1234567890"],
  "asset_groups": [
    {
      "name": "Asset Group 1",
      "headlines": ["Headline 1", "Headline 2", "Headline 3"],
      "long_headlines": ["Longer headline up to 90 characters"],
      "descriptions": ["Description 1", "Description 2"],
      "business_name": "Business Name",
      "final_urls": ["https://example.com"],
      "marketing_image_asset_ids": ["1234567890"],
      "square_marketing_image_asset_ids": ["1234567891"],
      "logo_asset_ids": ["1234567892"]
    }
  ]
}
```

> **CRITICAL (PMax)**: All three image asset types are REQUIRED with correct aspect ratios. The preview tool validates ratios before creation.

### Blueprint Features

| Feature | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Smart defaults** | Budget name, start date, network settings, ad group type auto-filled. |
| **Location resolution** | Pass `location_names` (human-readable) instead of IDs. |
| **Client-side validation** | Char limits, match types, image ratios checked before any API call. |
| **Batch operations** | Keywords, extensions, ad schedules batched for efficiency. |
| **Cleanup on failure** | Entire campaign removed if any step fails after campaign creation. |
| **Ad extensions** | Sitelinks, callouts, structured snippets — created and linked automatically. |
| **Ad scheduling** | Day-parting at campaign level via `ad_schedules`. |
| **Audiences** | Target or exclude audiences per ad group. |
| **Conversion actions** | Link specific conversion actions via `conversion_action_ids`. |

### Bidding Strategies

| Strategy | Fields | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MANUAL_CPC` | — | Manual cost-per-click. |
| `MAXIMIZE_CLICKS` | — | Default, good starting point. |
| `MAXIMIZE_CONVERSIONS` | `target_cpa_micros` (optional) | Requires conversion tracking. |
| `MAXIMIZE_CONVERSION_VALUE` | `target_roas` (optional) | Requires conversion values. |
| `TARGET_CPA` | `target_cpa_micros` (required) | Sets a target cost per acquisition. |
| `TARGET_ROAS` | `target_roas` (required) | Sets a target return on ad spend. |

> For PMax: `TARGET_CPA` and `TARGET_ROAS` are translated to constraints within `MAXIMIZE_CONVERSIONS` / `MAXIMIZE_CONVERSION_VALUE`.

### Technical Rules

- Budget in micros: $50 → 50,000,000.
- Create PAUSED; activate only after approval.
- Location resolution: use `location_names` in blueprint (auto-resolved) or `google_ads_search_locations` for manual lookup.
- RSA limits: headlines ≤30 chars (min 3), descriptions ≤90 chars (min 2).
- Creative source: only from the actual site; no generic claims.
- Image assets must already exist in the account (use `google_ads_list_assets` to find them).

## Campaign Workflow

Initial Setup → Research (site + GAQL + market) → Analyze (goals, audience, keywords) → Consult (options + trade-offs) → Recommend (structure + bids) → Confirm (summary approved) → Build Blueprint → Preview → User Approval → Create (PAUSED) → Activate (post-approval).

## GAQL Resource Compatibility

**Critical:** Not all Google Ads resources can be joined in a single query.

### search_term_view
Use `segments.keyword.info.*` for keyword text and match type — **never** `ad_group_criterion.*`:

```sql
SELECT
    search_term_view.search_term,
    customer.descriptive_name,
    segments.keyword.info.text,
    segments.keyword.info.match_type,
    campaign.name,
    ad_group.name,
    metrics.clicks,
    metrics.impressions,
    metrics.conversions,
    metrics.cost_micros
FROM search_term_view
WHERE segments.date DURING LAST_7_DAYS
ORDER BY metrics.impressions DESC
```

`ad_group_criterion` is **incompatible** with `search_term_view` as the FROM resource. Selecting `ad_group_criterion.*` fields will always fail with `PROHIBITED_RESOURCE_TYPE_IN_SELECT_CLAUSE`.

### keyword_view
For keyword performance (Quality Score, bid estimates):
```sql
SELECT
    ad_group_criterion.keyword.text,
    ad_group_criterion.keyword.match_type,
    metrics.clicks,
    metrics.impressions,
    metrics.historical_quality_score
FROM keyword_view
WHERE segments.date DURING LAST_30_DAYS
```

## Multi-Account Workflows (MCC)

When a user provides a manager account (MCC) with multiple sub-accounts:

### Batching Rule
**Never query more than 5 sub-accounts in a single run.** Each `google_ads_execute_gaql` call goes through a proxy with a timeout. Querying 10+ accounts sequentially in one loop reliably causes 504 timeouts.

Process in batches of 5 and aggregate results before proceeding:
```
Batch 1: accounts[0:5]   → collect results
Batch 2: accounts[5:10]  → collect results
Batch 3: accounts[10:15] → collect results
...merge all batches...
```

Announce progress to the user: `"Processing accounts 1-5 of 23..."`.

### 504 Timeout Recovery
If a `google_ads_execute_gaql` call times out (504 / "Google Ads API timed out after retries"):
1. The tool already retries 3× internally — do not retry immediately.
2. Reduce the scope: narrow the date range, add a `LIMIT`, or split the account list further.
3. Tell the user which accounts succeeded and which failed; do not silently drop accounts.

### Cross-Account Search Term Report (Most Common Use Case)

For MCC search term reports across many sub-accounts:

```
1. Get all accounts: google_ads_list_accounts()
   Filter to sub-accounts: [a for a in result.accounts if not a["manager"]]
2. For each batch of 5 accounts:
   - Run search_term_view GAQL (using segments.keyword.info.*, NOT ad_group_criterion).
   - Collect results tagged with customer.descriptive_name.
3. Merge all batches into a single dataset.
4. Write to Google Sheets or CSV file for the user.
```

Minimum required columns for a search term report:
- Search Term, Account Name, Keyword, Match Type, Campaign, Ad Group.
- Clicks, Impressions, Conversions, Cost.
- Add Negative (Yes/No — your recommendation).

## Critical Safety Rules

**Never:**
- Assume URL/budget/location IDs.
- Skip research.
- Invent keywords/copy.
- Apply rigid "best practices" without context.
- Build without buy-in.
- Skip the preview step before creation.
- Join `ad_group_criterion` with `search_term_view` in GAQL.
- Query more than 5 accounts in a single batch.

## Cached Data (optional, when `google_ads_query_insights` is exposed)

If the MCP exposes `google_ads_query_insights`, use it for large multi-account performance queries — it reads from a local cache refreshed hourly and avoids API timeouts entirely.

### Query Performance

Call `google_ads_query_insights` — its built-in description includes the exact table name, schema, and example queries. Read the tool description first, then pass a SQL query targeting that table. Typical pattern:

```
google_ads_query_insights(
  query="SELECT date, campaign_name, SUM(cost_micros) as spend, SUM(clicks) as clicks
         FROM <table>
         WHERE customer_id = '1234567890'
           AND date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
         GROUP BY date, campaign_name ORDER BY date DESC"
)
```

Replace `<table>` with the table name shown in the `google_ads_query_insights` tool description. Cache is refreshed hourly — no manual sync needed.

> **If the tool returns a "no data cached" error**, check the `suggestion` field in the response — it will contain the correct workspace-specific table name. Retry the query using that suggested table name instead.

Key columns available (verify in tool description):
- **Hierarchy:** `date`, `customer_id`, `campaign_id`, `campaign_name`, `campaign_status`
- **Volume:** `impressions`, `clicks`, `cost_micros` (÷ 1,000,000 for dollars)
- **Conversions:** `conversions`, `conversions_value`, `conversion_rate`
- **Efficiency:** `ctr`, `average_cpc`, `average_cpm`

Supports standard SQL aggregations and window functions. For cross-account queries, omit the `customer_id` filter and `GROUP BY` it instead.
